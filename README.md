# Dummy Api

Simple API with dummy data (users and products).

endpoint: 
- [endpoint] - https://dn8cfk-8080.csb.app/
- [GET USERS] - https://dn8cfk-8080.csb.app/users
- [GET USERS by id] - https://dn8cfk-8080.csb.app/users/1
- [GET PRODUCTS] - https://dn8cfk-8080.csb.app/products
- [GET PRODUCTS by id] - https://dn8cfk-8080.csb.app/products/1

  
## How does this work?

We run `yarn start` to start an HTTP server that runs on http://localhost:8080. You can open new or existing devtools with the + button next to the devtool tabs.
